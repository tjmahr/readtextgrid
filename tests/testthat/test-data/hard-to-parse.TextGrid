! A deliberate comment starts with a bang and ends on a new line
0  2.3  ! Here is a normal comment
<exists> ! This comment has a stray number 1

! Extra unquoted text is also a comment like the word "tiers" below
4 tiers         ! This comment has a stray quote "
"IntervalTier"  "! Fake Comment"
0  2.3  ! time domain of tier 1
3 interval coming
0  1  ""  ! interval 1 on tier 1
1  2  """"""  ! interval 2 on tier 1
2  2.3  "Not a ! Comment"  ! interval 3 on tier 1
"IntervalTier"  "Embedded ""String"" here"  ! type and name of tier 2
I guess some negative numbers are fine and make it into Praat
-0.5s  2.3
1 interval coming
-0.1  2.8s  "this string
has line breaks in it
and a ! fake comment
"
! testing comments that touch strings and numbers
! 1. "string"! throws an error in Praat so don't test that
"TextTier"  "point tier 1"
! 2. [NUMBER]!comment is handled fine by Praat
0.  2.3!touching a number
okay this is weird it won't see letternumber like this10
but it doesn't care about 2this
0.1
"point label"

! Finally include a bracketed number
points [3]:
    number = 0.8000000000000003
    mark = "point 3"

"TextTier"  "point tier 2" 0.  2.3
and now here is the weird part -10 ! points gets turned to 0


! and now here is another weird part. this doesn't get read because we said
! there are only 4 tiers
"TextTier"  "point tier 3" 0.  2.3 0
